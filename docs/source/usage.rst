Installation
------------

To use dggrid4py, first install it using pip:

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $ pip install dggrid4py


You need the ddgrid tool compiled available on the system.

Besides some lowlevel access influence the dggrid operationsâ€™ metafile
creation, a few highlevel functions are integrated to work with the more
comfortable geopython libraries, like shapely and geopandas

-  grid_cell_polygons_for_extent(): fill extent/subset with cells at
   resolution (clip or world)
-  grid_cell_polygons_from_cellids(): geometry_from_cellid for dggs at
   resolution (from id list)
-  grid_cellids_for_extent(): get_all_indexes/cell_ids for dggs at
   resolution (clip or world)
-  cells_for_geo_points(): poly_outline for point/centre at resolution

.. code:: python

   import geopandas
   import shapely

   from dggrid4py import DGGRIDv7

   # create an inital instance that knows where the dggrid tool lives, configure temp workspace and log/stdout output

   print(gdf5.head())
   gdf5.to_file('geopoint_cellids_from_points_isea4h_8.shp')

   # generate DGGS grid cell polygons based on 'cell_id_list' (a list or np.array of provided cell_ids)
   gdf6 = dggrid_instance.grid_cell_polygons_from_cellids(cell_id_list=[1, 4, 8], 'ISEA7H', 5)
   print(gdf6.head())
   gdf6.to_file('from_seqnums_isea7h_5.shp')

TODO
----

Contributions are welcome:

-  sample vector values into dggs cells (aka binning)

-  sample raster values into dggs cells

-  get parent_for_cell_id at coarser resolution

-  get children_for_cell_id at finer resolution
